Therefore, no reassignments can be made, and no missions can be actively pursued at this time. The most critical pending mission, 'M020' (High priority), cannot be started until robots are recharged or repaired."}}

Robot R2 is idle with full battery, but there are no unassigned missions requiring immediate action. Therefore, R2 will remain idle, ready for any new tasks that may arise."}}
